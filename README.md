## Paper Abstract
This paper presents a novel clustering algorithm, named Drop Ripple Counter, designed to address limitations inherent in traditional clustering techniques such as K-means and DBSCAN. The proposed algorithm was evaluated against these algorithms using a diverse set of datasets. The performance comparison focused on two key clustering validation metrics: Adjusted Rand Index and Adjusted Mutual Information. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm is on par or outperforms K-means and DBSCAN across multiple datasets in terms of the previously mentioned metrics, indicating superior performance in identifying underlying data structures and robustness to noise. These findings highlight the potential of our approach as a more effective alternative for a wide range of clustering applications
